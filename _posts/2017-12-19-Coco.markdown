From the second you hear that mariachi rendition of the Disney castle 'when you wish upon a star' intro, you know you're in for a treat. There's so much magic in the animation, the endless fractal buildings in the land of the dead, the photo-realistic, indulgent guitar playing scenes, in pretty much everything. The story is a simple one, but it's delivered full force with that Pixar charm and magic. I feel like the hype for this movie has been low, and overshadowed by bigger-ticket flicks, but that's borderline criminal, go see it while you can.
