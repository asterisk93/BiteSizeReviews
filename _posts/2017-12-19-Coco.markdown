From the second you hear that mariachi rendition of the Disney castle 'when you wish upon a star' intro, you know you're in for a treat. There's so much magic in the animation, the endless fractal buildings in the land of the dead, the photo-realistic, indulgent guitar playing scenes, and in pretty much everything around and in-between. The story is a simple one, but it's delivered full force with that classic Pixar charm and magic. I feel like the hype for this movie has been low, and overshadowed by bigger-ticket flicks. This is, in my opinion, borderline criminal, and I highly recommend that you go see it while you can.
