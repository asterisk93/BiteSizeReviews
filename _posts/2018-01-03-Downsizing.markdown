I don't know how I feel about this one. 5.5-6 out of 10. Downsized tries to do a lot, and is definitely more than the skin-deep comedy it's been marketed as. There is a surprising amount of penis contained within. The set design is easily the best part of this movie; settings and furniture are designed in a way that really sells the "we're tiny people living in a dollhouse" aesthetic. Matt Damon's (movie) wife is a shitty person that completely screws his life up due to frustrating, infuriating selfishness. There are attempts to be profound, but overall the movie has a loose, less-than-cohesive feel to it. You can watch this one at home without missing out on much. Maybe not with the family, because again, penis.
