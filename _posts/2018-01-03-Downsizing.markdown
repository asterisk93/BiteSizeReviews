Don't know how I feel about this one, guys. 5.5-6 out of 10. Downsized tries to do a lot, and is definitely more than the skin-deep comedy it's been marketed as. Surprising amount of penis in this movie. The set design is easily the best part of this movie; settings and furniture are designed in a way that really sells the 'we're tiny people living in a dollhouse' aesthetic. Matt Damon's wife is a shitty person that fucks my dude's life up. There are attempts to be profound, but overall the movie has a loose, less-than-cohesive feel to it. You can watch this one at home without missing out on much.
