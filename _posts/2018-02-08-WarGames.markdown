Flashback Film Fest 5/5.

The most uncanny thing about this film is easily how young Matthew Broderick is. This is a fun, light-hearted soft sci-fi hacker flick that probably gave a few less-than-tech-savvy people a scare when it came out. The characters are likeable, their motivations, relateable, and Broderick's exploits are believably clever. As techy as the subject matter is, WarGames never makes the error of demanding too much of its audience. Moreover, this movie almost seems to serve as a time capsule from an age where hard drives were still magnetic tape and floppy disks were the size of frisbees. I'd reccommend it as a comfortable watch with a story about what future a past time thought their now antiquated and obsolete tech could've led to.
