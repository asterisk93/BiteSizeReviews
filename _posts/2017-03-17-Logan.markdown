Heavy shit: the movie. Unfortunately, this is just a what-if timeline, but we are treated to the spectacular story line that is the unbreakable wolverine confronted with his mortality and legacy. The R rating is a blessing that allows this movie to pull no punches, and leaves the viewer feeling like they've witnessed the end of an era. Logan is a very fitting sendoff for the character.
