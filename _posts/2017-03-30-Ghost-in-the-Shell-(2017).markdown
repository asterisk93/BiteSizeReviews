When was this supposedâ€‹ to come out? We walked in after a pizza break and saw it on a whim. I can't speak to the faithfulness of the adaptation, but the aesthetic was gorgeous, and that car was cool as all hell. Scarlett Johansson very convincingly played what you imagine a human brain in a robot body would be like, from her expressions when talking to people, to they way she walks down hallways. Thematically, part of the story almost seems to run in parallel/juxtapose the casting controversy surrounding this film. Not Dragonball: Evolution by a long shot.
