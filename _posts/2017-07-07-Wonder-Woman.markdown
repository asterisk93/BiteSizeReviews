Wonder Woman was okay I guess. It really dragged on at bits, some of the fight scenes were laughable (but some good!), it couldn't decide what ending it wanted to have, and the god superpower stuff was really, really weird and took away from the film more than it gave. 10/10 acting, some groan worthy dialog (no man's land made me want to step on a landmine). 

Muddy writing spoils what had the potential to be a great and somewhat deep film, 6.5-7/10. This movie will drag on for a while between Diana doing cute stuff and exposition, and then you get to the church scene and another fight scene where WW DOES A KICK THAT IS STRAIGHT UP AVENGERS 1 LEVEL BADASS and you're like holy crap there just may be hope for this film yet. Definitely worth a watch, as it is a much needed strong showing from DC.
