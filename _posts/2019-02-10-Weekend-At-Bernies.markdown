At first, I was reluctant to watch this film, some random comedy flick that I hadn’t seen or heard of, that a friend had requested for a movie night out of curiosity, due to it being referenced by some other pop-culture thing I’d gone out of my way to avoid. “Can we not watch “Weekend at Bernie’s (1989)?” asked my tired, weary brain. This, it would turn out, would end up being a sin against god. Weekend at Bernie’s is one of the most perplexingly addictive movies I have ever seen. Strap in for an 80’s core adventure laden with questionable character decision making, slapstick circumstance, and a weird, urgent pace that only adds to the madness. This movie makes me wish there was an Oscar for “Best Immobile Performance from a Supporting Actor”, and if that doesn’t pique your interest enough to give it a watch, then get some friends together and prepare to be confused, unnerved, and entertained.
