In a time of superficial franchise revival and milking, how does a film like this exist? My theater was mostly deserted, but that in of itself is a crime because this movie was absolutely stellar. Half the time, Ryan Gosling is brilliantly playing his character, K. The other half of the time, he's playing a member of the audience reacting to Blade Runner 2049. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous. If grim, slow-burn sci-fi is your thing, then I reccommed this 100 times over.
