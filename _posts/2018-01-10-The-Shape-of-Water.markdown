9.5/10. Phenomenal world building, you see the time period come to life, blemishes and all. Every character feels tremendously human in this film, which just works so perfectly for a film whose central argument is the definition of humanity by means of contrast. I had a gut feeling, this inexplicable hunch, that I'd have to see this movie before declaring Blade Runner 2049 as my personal MOTY. I've never been more right than this. I dock the movie .5 out of pure spite because how dare you, Guillermo? How dare you not show me the thing? The back of the thing? That perfect setup for a narrative flourish just to leave me hanging? How dare?
