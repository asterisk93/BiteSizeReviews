Very funny, but cleverly funny. Some very exciting and entertaining scenes, and onscreen chemistry was great. This movie exists as an answer to the question of how many jokes can be crammed into a 'hero' movie before it stops being enjoyable. The sheer volume of comedy in this film does do it the slight disservice of undercutting any feeling of tension or high-stakes that it may be trying to impart on the viewer, and as the film reaches its climax, you're there more for the ride than you are to witness the triumph. Thankfully, it's a good ride.
