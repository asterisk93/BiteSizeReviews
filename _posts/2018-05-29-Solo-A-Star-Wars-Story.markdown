Solo was, by all counts, a surprisingly decent movie. Despite appearances of being an attempt to further milk nostalgia dollars out of  the original movie trilogy, Solo manages to stand apart, and feels refreshingly different from the standard star wars fare to date, treating viewers to an atmosphere and feel well suited to a mostly isolated side-adventure. Solo is an enjoyable ride with some familiar characters, some new faces, and an engaging story. Heavy hitters Woody Harrelson and Donald Glover play their parts charismatically, and Clarke and the leading guy that played Han have an interesting chemisty and dynamic that endures throught the film. Never at any point does this feel like a cheap retread. 
Solo relies on the original trilogy primarily as a means to invest viewers in its main protagonist duo (folks choosing this film as first step into original Star Wars territory may find it hard to get emotionally invested in Solo and the Wookie) but other than this prerequisite basis of interest, the movie endeavors and succeds at being its own movie. Solo takes very few risks, and at times, character interactions can feel a bit flat, but all in all the film manages to take what was once a throwaway name drop (the fabled Kessel Run) and build it into an interesting story in the Star Wars timeline.
