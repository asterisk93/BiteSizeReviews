It's a comfy family action movie whose story is simple, straightforward, and uncomplicated. There are genuinely funny moments and at no point did I feel like the movie was dragging along. The character arcs wrap up super cleanly and conveniently in an almost irritating way, but the centerpiece of this film is 100% meant to be Rock, Black, Gillian, and Hart acting like they are awkward children with growing pains trapped inside game-character bodies. It's a fun action comedy. Prime family movie night material. 6/10 paint by numbers story bumped up to a 7 by virtue of great acting work.
