DC has been in dire need of a theatrical win lately, and without going on and on about the saddening state of their cinematic universe, I feel that it’s safe to say that Aquaman was that win. In terms of narrative and pacing, the film has a sort of clunky, clumsy feel to it, and while individual story elements spiritually feel at times a bit like a Thor/Black Panther retread, the movie as a whole is energetic, fun, and soulful. Atlantis is rendered beautifully in actual colors instead of the usual, washed out DC palette, I’m at a loss trying to recall all the individual visual moments in the film that genuinely wowed me. Things like the brilliant 360 degree camera work during the early fight scenes, the massive underwater war, and the imposing sense of scale of the creature guarding the trident all succeed in driving home this feeling of wonder that makes this movie work so well. A satisfying movie with which to end the year.
