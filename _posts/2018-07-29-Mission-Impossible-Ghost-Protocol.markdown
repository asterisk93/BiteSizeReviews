The fourth installment of the Mission: Impossible series suffers primarily from a lack of Luther. The omission of IMF’s best dude aside, Ghost Protocol is a very light, fun addition to the series. Overall a very enjoyable movie-night fare flick. Suffers from a touch of action movie brainlessness, but not enough to hurt its watchability. (Mission: Impossible 2) Not the best we’ve seen from this franchise, but still a competent addition.
