I was a little late in seeing this, but PotA3 was pretty great. For how traditionally campy/comfy the original movies and remakes were, this reboot-reboot series having 3 8-9/10 movies is unprecedented. Literally this series is a gritty reboot of a comfy classic (Also a reboot) and has no business being this good, honestly. There's not much to say that can't already be assumed: Wonderful writing, great performances, loads of Andy Serkis working late nights and not being thanked for it.
