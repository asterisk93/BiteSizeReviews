Justice League was, well... It was better than I thought it'd be. That being said, I give it a 6.5/10. Lazy writing, bad pacing, and a very incidental villain make for a film that is enjoyable, but skin-deep. Individual characters are portrayed decently and screen chemistry is there, but there is this marvel-esque joviality that is so out of place and surreal given what led up to this. All of the imposing snyder gravitas, the tension and weight and urgency in MoS and BvS that set the stage for this film are pretty much squandered with this movie that starts, happens, and ends, with jokes sprinkled throughout. Go see it, if not just for this one amazing bit in the middle where [spoilers]
In an Avengers flick, when Iron Man cracks a witty one-liner joke, it feels natural because his character, since '08, has always been a wisecracking smartass. When a Batman who we were introduced to in a fairly dark, grim VS flick, who is sullen and grumpy and rage driven and who KILLS PEOPLE, does it, I laugh but also I'm weirded the heck out
