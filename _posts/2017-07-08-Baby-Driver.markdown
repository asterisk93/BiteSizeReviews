Baby Driver is hard to describe. If you like stunt driving and music or either of the two, go see it. The Edgar Wright trademark comfy is absent which works for creating serious, high tension moments, but his signature is still very much present. It's a mixtape music feature from start to end, but more dramatic than Guardians of the Galaxy and with way more soul than in Suicide Squad (SS had none tbh) Gonna buy this when it comes out.
