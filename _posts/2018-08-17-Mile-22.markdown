A huge fan of Iko Uwais’ work, I had high expectations for Mile 22 going in. The film is an attempt at an "operator/infiltration team" story that is for the most part decently paced and has good firefight scenes, but the plot feels runaround and disingenuous as story critical details are withheld until the very end only to be clumsily delivered in a big block of exposition. While the story itself is passable, the film’s greatest sin is felt when watching its fight scenes. Combat choreography feels impressive, but the editing, lighting, and framing during these sequences is so poor that it’s hard to make out much of any of the action. Kicks and punches are indistinguishable, and the flips that would’ve otherwise wowed, instead looked confusing and arbitrary. Setting up for a sequel at the end may have been in vain.
