 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the realest real moment in Jumanji (one of precious few) is a gaming self-insert moment near the end of the movie where the hero is about to finish the game and is conflicted between returning to his real life as a weak, awkward, breakable person and staying behind to remain as his godlike super-powered Dwayne The Rock Johnson virtual self for even so much as a moment longer. There's a point, sometimes, near the end of an escapism adventure where you feel like you want to make sure you've done absolutely everything before playing that final cutscene and seeing the credits roll, because you, your life, and the problems you were trying to numb with imagination are still very much alive and waiting for you in the real world on the other side of that credits marquee. You look for any reason to stave off victory with more adventure. By all means, his character should be more excited than anything to get back to his new conveniently designated irl nerd girlfriend, and yet they give him this moment of hesitation that almost has no business being in a movie this simplified at all. For someone like myself, who has frequently found themselves turning to writing, music, video games, and even (as some of you may be surprised to find out) cinema, all as forms of escapism, this particular scene in the family-fun branded blockbuster adventure flick that is the new Jumanji was an empathetic uppercut to the jaw, lying in wait at the end of what was essentially supposed to be brand milking that had no business being as good as it was.
