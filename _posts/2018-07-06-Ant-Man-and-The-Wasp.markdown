The Ant-Man sequel, although having been released only about two or so months after Infinity War, is fully focused on being an Ant-Man sequel. Taking place indepenedly of this year's Avengers film, we see Scott Lang dealing with the residual fallout from Civil War. The Ant-Man humor and shenanigans that made the first film such a fun watch are back in full force, coupled with clever grow/shrink fight choreography, witty banter, and Michael Pe√±a. While on paper, this movie has the right ingredients for another great family-fun Marvel flick, it is unfortunately bogged down by one of Marvel's arguably  weakest villain presences to date. This comes as a disappointment as the movie's key components are present and well executed (action sequences, character humor, chemistry), but in the absence of a passable villain oriented storyline/conflict to tie them together, in addition to a somewhat lazy conclusion of convenience, "Ant-Man and the Wasp" ends up falling flat. At the end of the day, however, It's fun, so go see it if you want to kill an evening.
