Detective Pikachu, despite having a somewhat loose story, still manages to hit the right notes needed to engage an audience. Ryan Reynold’s pika-performance is great, and his wisecracks and witticisms are well received, and Justice Smith does well, both in times of comedy and emotional weight, to convince the viewer that he has chemistry with a big CGI mouse. A shocking amount of detail and love has obviously been put into the development of this world, and Ryme City is a character in of its own, vibrant, bustling, full of life, and always drawing your eye away to hunt for some other small detail or easter egg. Paired with the stellar facial expression animation on the tituar pokemon, I’d say that this is a fun, family friendly flick that succeeds at bringing a world to life.
