Dunkirk was a solid 8/10 war movie. If you're gonna see it, IMAX is a must. Non-linear narrative structure and somber, anxious atmosphere make for a damn good movie, but it won't appeal to everyone. Stellar sound design will have you leaving the theater riddled with bullet wounds and shell-shock. Stellar visuals and good storytelling make for a film that will likely remain a prominent 2017 highlight.
