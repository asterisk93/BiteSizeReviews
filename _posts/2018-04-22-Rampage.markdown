Rampage is essentailly a somewhat mediocre video game adaptation film. Although decently paced, there are occasional moments of attempted humor that detract significantly from the movie's feel and momentum. It's villains are comically stereotypical and completely devoid of nuance. Dwayne Johnson's regular rocky charisma is strangely muted in this protagonist role, and his "animals are more trustworthy than humans" action hero portrayal is awkward when compared to his strong showing in Jumanji. 
That being said, the action in this film is fantastic, and giant monster fans will have more than enough action to keep them satisfied. By all accounts this would be a 6/10 flick had it not been for how fantastic some of the action sequences looked. All bets are off once the giant reptile shows up. If giant monster flicks are your thing, you'll at least have some fun with Rampage.
