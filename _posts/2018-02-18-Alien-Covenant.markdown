Time, once again, to dive into the very special flavour of sci-fi body horror that can only be found in an 'Alien' film. 'Alien: Covenant' is a direct continuation of the series 'prequel', Prometheus, and insofar as Prometheus is concerned, Covenant is a good sequel. While the in-universe implications of the story are a bit questionable for me in terms of cohesiveness, as a self-contained unit alongside Prometheus, Covenant's story is logical and well paced. Fassbender's acting is fantastic. Expect the standard fare of Alien horror staples (chestbursting, corridor sequence, etc.) and you'll be in for a good time. It's not mind-blowingly good, and can sometimes err on the side of being too derivative, but succeeds as a standard movie-night crew-vs-monster flick.
