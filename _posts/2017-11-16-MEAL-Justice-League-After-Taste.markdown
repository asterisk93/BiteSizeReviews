In an Avengers flick, when Iron Man cracks a witty one-liner joke, it feels natural because his onscreen character, since '08, has always been a wisecracking smartass. When a Batman who we were introduced to in a fairly dark, grim 'VS' flick, who is sullen and grumpy and rage driven and who KILLS PEOPLE, does it, I still laugh at the quip, but also I'm weirded the heck out.
