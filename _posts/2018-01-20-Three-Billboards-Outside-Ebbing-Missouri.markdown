A well written story driven by some heavy hitting performances. This is probably my favorite Woody Harrelson role of all time. Beautifully shot, with some minor pacing hiccups. At the core of 'Three Billboards' is a revenge story in tandem with a redemption story, with entangled character dramas all underpinned by the mystery of who killed a girl. The only real negatives I had with this film were: The 'dumb teenage girl' character who is written as a cheap piss-take attempt at comic relief, and who, given the nuanced approach to the characters around her, serves only to cheapen the film. Also, there's a scene midway through with a deer (presumably sacred, possibly cgi) that should be killed.
