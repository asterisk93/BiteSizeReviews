The Incredibles 2 was tragically overdue, yet absolutely fantastic experience that was at all times thoroughly entertaining. Despite over a decade of waiting, Incredibles 2 picks up right where the first film left off, and powers on with a familiar mix of action, comedy, and family-feel-good moments. There is a childish obviousness to the film's main villain, but with that simplicity comes a surprising amount of moving ideological parts and depth that was neither found nor missed in its predecessor. While still, at its core, a family friendly hero action-adventure aimed at kids, The Incredibles 2 appears to have been written with a more subtle touch, throwing its characters into morally opposed, yet ideologically comparable circumstances. After all was said and done, I left the theater feeling like The Incredibles 2 was a more than worthy sequel.
