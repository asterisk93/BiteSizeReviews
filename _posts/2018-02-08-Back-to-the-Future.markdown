Flashback Film Fest 4/5.

I feel like everyone has seen this movie at least once. For me, I'd watched it as a child on YTV movie Saturdays, cut apart and superimposed with commercial breaks for toys and cartoons. I was a child, and so walking out of a theater having seen Back to the Future for the first time as an adult, I was genuinely taken aback by the sheer extent to which it was better than the version of it that I had stored away in childhood memories. There is nothing in this movie I'd want to change. The story is cohesive, the characters, tremendously likeable, the humour, funny without a feel of cheapening the movie. If it's been a while, take a night, grab some pals, and give it another watch.
