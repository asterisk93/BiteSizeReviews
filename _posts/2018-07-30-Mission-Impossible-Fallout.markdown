"Mission: Impossible - Fallout" is the best M:I movie to date. It was definitely worth seeing this in IMAX! The action was visceral, the stunts, insane. The addition of Henry Cavill’s unconventional character as a foil to Cruise’s Ethan Hunt adds a competitive dimension to the film that, in parallel with the film’s main plot, keeps viewers interested in seeing who ultimately gets the better of whom in a rivalry that is deepened even more by Cruise and Cavill’s uncanny onscreen chemistry. Almost every action sequence has a “shout” moment that will at the very least get an audible gasp out of you. A shot of Tom Cruise breaking his leg is used and visible in the final act, which nicely sums up the crew’s all-in approach to stuntwork this time around that paid dividends on the big screen. I’d go see this again.
