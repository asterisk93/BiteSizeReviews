The Disaster Artist: 8/10 vanilla, 10/10 if you're already a fan of The Room. The movie reads a lot like a biopic/documentary and so it's hard to give it a rating based on factual accuracy. That being said, in terms of pacing, entertainment value, and overall watchability, this movie excels. If you haven't seen the room, you'll probably want to see it after this. The centerpiece here is James goddamn Franco's almost note-perfect, mind blowing portrayal of Tommy Wiseau. Holy shit, the accent, the body language, the laugh, he covers every base, he becomes the Wiseau. The sheer amount of effort put into creating a detailed replica of the best/worst movie ever made is staggering. If you're uninitiated to this whole "The Room" thing, expect a strange, yet ultimately uplifting, inspiring film about an eccentric director, an impressionable kid, following your dreams, and having it pay off in unexpected ways. If you're already on board, I don't really have to tell you what to expect. Go see the man who played Green Goblin('s son) morph before your eyes into a strange little man of unexpected wealth and ambiguous international origin. What a story. Oh, high marks.
