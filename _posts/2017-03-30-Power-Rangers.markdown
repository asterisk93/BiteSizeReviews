Power Rangers: Lots of good character development, wish they would've taken a more practical cgi approach with the combat like in the originals, but for what it was supposed to be, I'd say it was a good film. Overall very enjoyable, some more mature themes but never erring too much on the side of being arbitrarily gritty or grimdark. I loved Billy Cranston as a character.
