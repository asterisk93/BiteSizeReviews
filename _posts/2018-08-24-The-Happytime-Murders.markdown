The Happytime Murders was a pretty hilarious movie, but at times, it was so massively over the top with the adult jokes that it felt a bit forced and disingenuous. This is a hard sentence for me to write, but Melissa McCarthy was really enjoyable in this. If had toned down some of the more arbitrarily adult stuff (not too much, I don't hate fun), I think there would’ve been a real shot at a good, ironic, hard-boiled detective drama. What we got was more brainless, but not for lack of enjoyment. I really do feel that with this calibre of voice acting and puppetry, we could’ve gotten something truly remarkable had The Happytime Murders taken itself just a little bit more seriously.
