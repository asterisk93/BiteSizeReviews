A far cry from its tight and balanced predecessor, The Equalizer 2 is packed with fights and good deeds as expected, but is delivered in a way that feels disorganized and confusing. Fight scenes are well choreographed and Denzel Washington’s charisma shines through in the casual scenes, but the central conflict of the film is somewhat uninspired, and a major plot point, if not obvious before, is revealed so casually that none of the parties involved seem to care. So lacking is the impact of the plot that the characters involved seem almost completely indifferent to its development or resolution.
