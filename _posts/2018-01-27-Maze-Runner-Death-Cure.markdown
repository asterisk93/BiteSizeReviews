I have very little to say about this movie. It's okay for what it tries to be, which is a high-energy avergage YA-Novel finale for an average YA-Novel series. Everything is here: the tropey romance, the trope sacrifice, the trope protagonist-ex-machina plot device. It succeeds insofar as having likeable characters, enjoyable action, and solid pacing, but I found the ending and wrap up to be a bit too hammy for my tastes. Chances are, if you've enjoyed the Maze Runner series thus far, you'll find this to be a satisfactory conclusion.
