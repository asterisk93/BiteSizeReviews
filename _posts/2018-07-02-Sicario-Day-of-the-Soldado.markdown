I ennoyed the first Sicario movie quite a bit, And with all of the dramatic, high octane advertising that surrounded the sequel, I was quite excited going in. 

Originally marketed under the name "Sicario 2: Soldado" (or even just "Soldado", the sequel had been marketed as an explosive story closely following the exploits of Benicio Del Toro's seasoned cartel Hitman, tantalizing users with the prospective carnage that would ensue as a result of him being "turned loose" with "no rules this time". "Soldado", an intimidating, to-the-point title, would later suffer an inexplicably late name change to "Sicario: Day of the Soldado", a title more bloated and run-around much like the movie we ended up getting. Dubious packaging aside, Sicario 2 plays out more like a novel than it does an action film, containing within a long, slow-burn chain of events.  The story, while thoughtfully laid out and executed, is paced in so sparse a way that I found it took noticeable effort on my part to stay invested in the events on screen, and that the only reason I hadn't was because of how much I really /wanted/ to stay invested, not being one to shy away from an intricate story. 

While the narrative chain of events is coherent, I feel like the duality of Del Toro's character being both a compassionate figure and a ruthless killer was very clumsily handled, and that his character, a major draw to both this and the previous film, feels so arbitrary to the plot that you leave it feeling like you haven't watched much of a sequel at all.
