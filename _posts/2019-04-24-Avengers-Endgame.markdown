The promised conclusion to over a decade of anticipatory setup, Avengers: Endgame delivers character development in spades. Less action driven than its battle-fuelled previous chapter, Endgame dedicates more time to emotional content and weight, focusing primarily on the fallout of Infinity War. I can’t say much here without giving anything away, but I will say that you’ll definitely want to be caught up on every MCU movie to date before giving this a watch if you want to get the most out of it.
