I had to see this one multiple times, which is impressive because the showtimes in toronto were really wonky and inconsistent. Enjoyed it a lot! Gorgeous visuals, a good soundtrack, and an endearing plot really draw you in to this world and its characters. It's a happy-sad anime romance. If that kind of sounds like your thing, you'll probably have a good time with this.
