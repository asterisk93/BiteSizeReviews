I found myself pleasantly surprised several times over while watching this, the one that started it all. The movie as a whole has aged quite well. Dated special effects are discernible, but don’t take much, if anything, away from the film when you do notice them because they aren’t the main dish, but merely a seasoning to a film that would still feel meaty without them. The plot is set to a brisk pace, just slow enough to keep the audience informed, but never meandering too much in one place. Characters are intriguing enough to be of consequence even if they aren’t given much screen time at all. This one is a classic.
