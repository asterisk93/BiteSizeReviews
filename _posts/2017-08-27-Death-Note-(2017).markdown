Netflix's Death Note was just OK, save for a really lazy plot bit in the middle that more or less ruined it for me. Despite being clumsy, our protagonist manages to completely elude all sympathy. The writing is very cliche high school teen drama. Killing people becomes a key factor in Light's love life, which is but one of many factors that seem to go against the spirit of the source material. None of the ruthless cunning or the megalomania of the original Light Yagami is present. All in all, it's worth a watch I guess, but it mostly comes across as a soulless mess of which I cannot call myself a fan.
