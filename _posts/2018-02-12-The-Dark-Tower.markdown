There's something about The Dark Tower that leaves you feeling unfulfilled after it ends. This is likely due to yet another case of a large amount of source material being truncated down into a film adaptation. Idris Elba makes for a compelling hero, and the gunplay and action sequences in the film are enjoyable, but there's nothing here that really takes ahold of you and makes you want to invest yourself in the world of the film. It happens, the plot is resolved, and then it's over. It's an entertaining watch, but fancy reloading tricks aside, there's nothing else that really stands out. The characters feel ridgid and unalive, as if everyone is here to fill their role and then go home. A story where literally everything is supposed to be at stake is lost on the viewer because the film fails to drive that point home, and the result is a final act with an uncanny lack of gravity or tension.
