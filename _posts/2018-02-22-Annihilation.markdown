Sci-fi body horror has definitely been a major recurring theme this season, but when compared to other present contenders like Alien: Covenant or The Cloverfield Paradox, I'd have to say that Annihilation has done it the best. Annihilation is one of the most profoundly disturbing movies I've seen in a long time, and I left the theater feeling simultaneously like I never wanted to see it again, and that I wanted to 100% add it to my halloween horror playlist. Annihilation is unnerving, and early on will find ways to (sometimes literally) get underneath your skin. The final act is a full out psychedelic trip that, on a theater-sized screen and with theater-sized speakers, will knock you on your ass. Probably not the best date movie, but a damn good sci-fi film all the same.
