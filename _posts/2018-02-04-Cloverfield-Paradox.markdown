Paradox, the third installment of J. J. Abrams' until now presumably anthological Sci-fi Horror film series, starts very strong out of the gate. What ensues is an interesting body-horrorish thriller reminiscent of 'Alien' and 'Sunshine'. Like its predecessor, '10 Cloverfield Lane', there is a solid sci-fi flick contained within this movie that seems to only be bogged down by its loose narrative shackling to the clover-verse. The 'Cloverfield' branding is where it seems to flounder most-noticeably, and I would recommend to anyone planning to watch that they first attempt to mentally divorce it from its counterparts, as the narratice and causal links feel cheap, weak, and thrown in. The movie does attempt to establish an overarching causality to the whole sordid affair, but making sense of it requires an amount of effort far exceeding that of the payoff. The ending scene was killer note to end on that I found to be equal parts fantastic and arbitrary.
