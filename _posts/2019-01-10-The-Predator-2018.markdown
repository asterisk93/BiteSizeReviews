The Predator is passable at best, and at times reads like a direct-to-dvd movie sequel. The concept of the Alpha-predator feels underdeveloped, and large bits of narrative are clunkily revealed in throwaway expository lines. What this leaves you with is a somewhat brainless action flick with cringey comedy bits and CGI effects that vary in quality from “pretty good” to “early 2000’s bad”. While gratuitous sequelbait, a loose narrative, and a villain/ally of convenience bring this film down, the action is decently paced throughout and, to its credit, I found myself wowed by the spectacle enough to make sitting through it relatively effortless. It’ll go down as one of the lesser entries in the franchise, but is still worth a watch if you’ve got nothing to do.
