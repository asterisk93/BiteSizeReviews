Overall, a very enjoyable movie. After TFA, I was hungry for a Star Wars movie that actually tries to do something new, and TLJ definitely delivered in that respect. There are some questionable pacing choices in the first third and a lot of plot stuff that left a sour taste in my mouth, but once this movie got going, I was enjoying myself, especially in the third act. The battle on the salt planet was gorgeous, and for all of TLJ's confusing writing bits, the fantastic million-dollar visuals still manage to deliver that Star-Wars sense of trademark sci-fi wonder.
