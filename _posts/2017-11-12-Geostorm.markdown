Pretty standard disaster flick meets dad thriller. Tropey at times. The word 'camp' comes to mind but also doesn't really fit because it's got that 2017 polish on it. Pretty shallow sci-fi wise: in the future, there's only one brand of future-phone used by literally everyone, guns have no recoil, and politicians still suck. If you show up expecting anything even slightly insightful re: climate change, don't, we fix climate change in the first 30 seconds of the movie and it's never mentioned again. This is a Saturday afternoon AMC movie. Enjoyable, but it's like Day After Tomorrow, Gravity, and Armageddon all got together and were like "Hey let's raise a child" and then the plot of 3 idiots and a baby happens and Geostorm is the awkward adolescence of that child. It's fun, go see it
