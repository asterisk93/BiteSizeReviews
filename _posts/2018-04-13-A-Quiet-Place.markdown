Atmosphere and tension are at the forefront of John Krasinski's new breakthrough horror film. Ensuring that you actually have -a quiet place- to watch A Quiet Place is of paramount importance. From the very first pre-title sequence, a feeling of anxious urgency is established that sticks around for the entirety of the film. This is a fine, fine addition to the horror genre, and definitely a great movie to add to a scary movie marathon. A Quiet Place is well paced in a way that allows the world {and the mystery that is the tragedy that has befallen it) to be developed at an interesting rate, while still focusing on the protagonist family and the imminent danger they are constantly in. This is an excellent watch either in a theater, or at night on a laptop screen with headphones.
