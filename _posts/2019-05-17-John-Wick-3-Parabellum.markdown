John Wick 3 gets right to the point and tosses its audience headfirst into a tense, pressure cooker atmosphere, opening with some ridiculously high-energy Raid Redemption quality combat sequences. The movie allows itself to open up a bit more as it moves along, and at times the disparity between its high and low energy moments can be a bit dizzying. Overall, this chapter of John Wick makes for a fantastic no-holds-barred adrenaline-action movie with lots of over-the-top executions and almost Jackie Chan inspired environmental stuntwork. I saw it twice, and probably wouldnâ€™t mind seeing it again.
