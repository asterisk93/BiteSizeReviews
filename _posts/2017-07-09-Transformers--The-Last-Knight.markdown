Michael Bay's "Transformers: The Last Knight" aka "A masterclass on how to make the apocalypse boring as watching your nails grow". 3.5 to 4/10. Seriously this movie was a crock of shit. I think my favorite bit of Transformers 5 is when Optimus Prime introduces himself, gives a contrived speech, says he'll lead the charge into the enemy base and then does a sick rocket jump into the fray and then you don't see him for the next half hour of the movie. Save your money, watch this on Netflix or something when it comes out.

Right, so. This is Transformers... 5, I think? Where do I even begin? Here are some negatives off the top of my head: 

>the movie starts with "England, The Dark Ages" as a vague setting caption. Here we are, mixing Sci-fi robots with Arthurian Legend, except extremely vaguely because we want to fuzz over the whole "Autobots are the vanguard of human history" bit but not really commit to backing it up. 

>bumblebee fuckin fought in WWII LMAO 

>TRANSFORMERS KILLED HITLER LMAO 

>Shia LaBeouf is a descendent of the Templar like bloodline cult of the LaBeoufs who are all descendants of Merlin aka the original LaBeouf but he isn't in this movie so literally just after revealing this info we're gonna go ahead and pretend he doesn't exist after showing his face on screen and call you, Lady Protagonist, the last of the LaBeoufs 

>Protagonist romance is so poorly written, starts out as "I'm a sexy intelligent English professor lady and you're a dumb American", and then every third line about the female is about how she's hot and cleavage city. She keeps it profesh with the hero man until she sees him with his shirt off, finds out that he's got abs, and suddenly she's in love 

>ROUGHLY 60-70% OF OPTIMUS PRIME'S DIALOGUE IS HIM INTRODUCING HIMSELF 

>you go into this expecting explosions and action and then you're hit with a poorly paced, single paragraph essay of exposition that is so exhausting that when shit finally does blow up you're too drained to enjoy it 

>I AM OPTIMUS PRIME

>the funniest part of this movie is that the crazy dude from the first few movies says the words "Goat Scrotum"
