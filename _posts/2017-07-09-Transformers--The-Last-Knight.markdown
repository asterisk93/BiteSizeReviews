Michael Bay's "Transformers: The Last Knight" aka "A masterclass on how to make the apocalypse boring as watching your nails grow". 3.5 to 4/10. Seriously this movie was a crock of shit. I think my favorite bit of Transformers 5 is when Optimus Prime introduces himself, gives a contrived speech, says he'll lead the charge into the enemy base and then does a sick rocket jump into the fray and then you don't see him for the next half hour of the movie. Save your money, watch this on Netflix or something when it comes out.
