In this film, Liam Neeson plays a family man with a very particular set of skills, skills he has acquired over a very long career, skills that make him a nightmare for certain people that he is tasked to find and who as a potential result of his finding them may end up killed. Taken jokes aside, The Commuter is a solid mystery thriller that doesn't drag and keeps you interested up until its conclusion. The story reads like that of a pulpy thriller novel, and with great action sequences (multi-track drifting?!) and a very capable lead, it succeeds as being a very good movie night fare flick to watch with your friends.
