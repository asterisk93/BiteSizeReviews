I saw this twice, and part of me still would effortlessly pay to see it again. I liken the feeling to when I’d watched movies like “Redline” or “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World” for the first time, and was hit with this feeling that I’d just seen something uniquely special. Into the Spider-Verse is art in motion. The film itself feels like a graffiti mural, a spontaneous burst of artistic and stylistic celebration that focuses on themes of hope, personal expression, and individuality, all of which make for an uplifting watch overall. There is a clever balance struck between joviality and seriousness that allows the movie to be funny, but not disposable, and as enticing as the flashy, stylized visuals may be, it is this massive amount of “heart” that this film has that’ll have you wanting to see it again.
