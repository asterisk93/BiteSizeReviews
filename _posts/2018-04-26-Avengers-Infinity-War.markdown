Infinity war is a grand spectacle 10 years in the making that delivers on its promised scale and gravitas in excess. This movie is Marvel's greatest cinematic achievement to date: A hero ensemble movie that is absolutely packed to the seams with developed, memorable "protagonist" characters, while also managing to be a cohesive, well-paced action thriller. Thanos, the universe's big baddie, who has until now only been teased to the audience with brief glimpses in post-credit stingers, now takes centre stage with dramatic weight, charisma, and depth of writing. The final moments of the film, which shall not be divulged here, managed to cut a swath of absolute stunned silence through what had moments ago been a lively, cheering, premiere-night theater audience. However, Infinity War is far, far more than the weight of its ending. Heartfelt moments and stellar action sequences definitely make this a film to see again.
