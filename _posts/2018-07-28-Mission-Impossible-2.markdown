After the masterful attention to pacing and characters I’d witnessed in the first Mission: Impossible film, I was excited to continue and dove straight into the sequel. 

To say I have tonal whiplash would be an understatement. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was the movie that first coined the phrase “over the top”, because Mission: Impossible 2 is the essence of overindulgence. This is the most hammy, confusingly indulgent action movie I’ve ever seen. 

Mission: Impossible 2 is one of the best bollywood action films I've ever seen, and I commend the director on his decision to cut out all the musical numbers and to not put any indian people in the film.

My soul has left my body.
