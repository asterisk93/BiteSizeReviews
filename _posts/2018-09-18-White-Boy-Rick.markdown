White Boy Rick was a watch that was disappointingly adequate. At its core lay a compelling story, but the pacing and editing left something to be desired, feeling at times obtrusive and unsure. Many scenes didnâ€™t particularly flow well into one another, making for a jarring experience where the audience is left to try to derive what ought to be simple, factual connections between plot events. Overall this film feels competent, but disjointed.
