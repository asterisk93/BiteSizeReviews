The fifth Mission: Impossible film is a damn good summer blockbuster, and a great addition to the franchise that is anything but procedural. The addition of a cerebral villain of consequence is very welcome, making for an engaging, edge-of-your seat plotline that makes good use of the space between stunt sequences. The stunts themselves have been ramped up, and the plane sequence, for example, (the movieâ€™s opening scene) will have you looking for any evidence of movie magic, for wires or the telltale gloss of cgi, only to elude you completely and leave you with the only conclusion that tom cruise is in fact hanging from a jumbo jet mid takeoff.
