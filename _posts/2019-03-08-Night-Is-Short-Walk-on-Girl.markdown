“Night Is Short” is a wonderfully animated film that depicts an long and complex series of events as they unfurl over the course of a single night adventure. The animation is vibrant, dynamic, and full of life, allowing every step of this loopy odyssey to be thematically striking and visually spectacular. The pacing of this story is breakneck, and narrative arcs are brought up, resolved, and revisited later in such rapid succession that it makes the movie feel double its length, as if an entire season’s worth of material has been condensed into its standard 1.5 hour runtime. Although it requires the viewer's utmost attention, I’d go as far as to call it a masterpiece of an anime film that will no doubt stand out as an instant classic for years to come.
