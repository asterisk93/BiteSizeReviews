The first 10 minutes of Mission: Impossible 3 do a spectacular job of cutting through any apprehension one might have felt in trusting this franchise with another movie after assault on the senses that was Mission: Impossible 2. The McGuffin plotline is fairly obvious from the outset, but the movie does a good job of maintaining a tense feeling of urgency throughout. Phillip Seymour Hoffmanâ€™s deadpan villain is fantastic. Overall, very JJ Abrams-y, as his style is very visible in this film.
