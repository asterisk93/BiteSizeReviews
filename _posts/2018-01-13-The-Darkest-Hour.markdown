The Darkest Hour is a grim retelling of the events surrounding Churchill's appointment to office and his attempts to bolster the UK's fighting spirit. While I don't know my history well enough to speak to the accuracy of the events depicted, I have to give this film an 8-9/10 because pf the sheer magnitude of Gary Oldman's acting chops. In this film, we get to see my close and personal friend Gary play the role of an Old Man. You could probably see this as a stage play with Oldman as Churchill and still feel the gravitas and the charisma that are very much the centerpiece of this film. This is a very monologue driven film that takes 'best actor' tier talent to carry and so Oldman's 'Best Actor' Oscar nomination is 300% deserved.
