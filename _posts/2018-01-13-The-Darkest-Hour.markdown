Darkest Hour was a grim recounting of the events surrounding Churchill's appointment to office and his attempts to bolster the UK's fighting spirit. While I don't know my history well enough to speak to the accuracy of the events depicted, I have to give this film an 8-9/10 because holy shit the acting chops on Gary Oldman. In this film, we get to see my close and personal friend Gary play the role of an Old Man. You could probably see this as a stage play with Oldman as Churchill and still feel the gravitas and the charisma that are very much the centerpiece of this film. This is a film that takes 'best actor' tier talent to carry and so Oldman's nomination is 300% deserved
