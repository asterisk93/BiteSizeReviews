IT'S GOOD. I've been waiting years for a proper marvel-studios spidey flick, and it's here! We've got one! It's a good one! It delivered! Towards the end of Garfield's run at the character, the silver-screen fatigue was already starting to set in. Thankfully, (surprisingly?) none of that fatigue is present in Homecoming, and it manages to bring a feeling of freshness by skipping over an origin story we've already seen twice. Most importantly, this is the most three-dimensional writing we've seen in an MCU villain to date. Iron Man is a welcome addition as he manages to add his own unique comedic flavour, while never serving as a distraction from the Peter Parker focused storyline. Hopefully this is a sign that we'll see better written Marvel villains in the future? One can only hope.
