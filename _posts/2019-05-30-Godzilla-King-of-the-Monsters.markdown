King of the Monsters is a far cry from its 2014 predecessor. The Kaiju are here, and this time around, they are here in force. The human drama has thankfully taken a back seat this time around, and there are plenty of gargantuan fights and “oh shit” moments to thrill and entertain. Toho Godzilla fans will be pleased to find a surprising amount of original and reimagined theme music sprinkled throughout as garnish, a small testament to the origins of these historic, beloved characters. When all was said and done, I found myself thoroughly exhausted from the sheer amount of spectacle that had been thrown at my face, and from the amount of times it made me physically react. Seeing this in IMAX is a must, and be sure to stick around for the post-credits scene!
