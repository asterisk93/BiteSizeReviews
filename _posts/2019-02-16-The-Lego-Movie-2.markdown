Coming out of the gate with maybe a little less of the freshness and exuberance of its predecessor, this is a Lego Movie that once again exceedingly succeeds in being a charming, vibrant, and funny family experience. The production quality and visual effects are still brilliantly done with that unique lego flare. While lagging behind the original Lego Movie in terms of emotional impact, the story is still enjoyable and capstoned with an uplifting moral objective. From basic fart jokes to tongue-in-cheek meta humor, The Lego Movie 2 should be a fun watch for kids, student debt ridden adults, and student debt free adulter-adults alike. There’s not much else to say, other than (in summary) It’s good, but not as good as the first one, but still very good.
