I saw this in IMAX, and boy, am I glad I saw this in IMAX. The IMAX theater at my local go-to cinema has the speakers turned up ever so slightly too loud, which worked entirely to this filmâ€™s benefit. Bohemian Rhapsody is not the fact-driven Queen biopic that some may be expecting, but is instead a bombastic celebration of the band and its frontman, set to stadium rock that has its power multiplied tenfold by being blasted over theater speakers. Rami Malek is absolutely phenomenal as Freddie Mercury, and his physical performance and mannerisms hit all the right notes. The recreation of the Queen Live-Aid performance at the end is the real gem of this movie, and unfortunately is the closest anyone in my generation will come to seeing them play live.
