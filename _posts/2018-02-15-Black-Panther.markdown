This movie was an absolute delight to watch. The story is more or less self-contained and the bits from Civil War that are important to the plot are shown via flashback. This is important, because in my opinion this film is best enjoyed by putting up a mental divide between this and the rest of the MCU. There is more than enough going on in Wakanda to keep you captivated without worrying about what Stark or Rogers are upto. The sci-fi afrofuturism aesthetic proudly takes center stage, almost a character in its own right, and you can see the aesthetic melding of tech and african cultural influences in everything from the costumes, to the gadgets, to the console interfaces. Next comes the score, which is a blend of theatrical fanfares and predominant tribal drums which serve to highlight the grandiose, imposing nature of a city of technological marvels hidden away from the outside world. The story is straightforward, and once more, following the success of Spiderman: Homecoming, we are gifted with another nuanced and well-written Marvel villain. The movie never feels like it drags on at all, the story is well paced, and you come out of it not feeling its two-hour length. Fight choreography is thought-out and well executed, and the battles are tension-filled without much of the action being lost to editing. Black Panther's story sets it apart from standard good-vs-evil Marvel fare, as it engages with genuinely morally grey conflicts that can't necessarily be wrapped up neatly with a right answer. What results is an enjoyable sci-fi movie that explores themes of heritage and isolationism, and that manages to feel overwhelmingly fresh and innovative despite its ties to a cinematic universe that tends to err on the side of being more cut-and-dry formulaic.
