Originally I’d supposed “Broly” to be one of those limited 2-3 day anime movie limited event screenings, and while I had fond childhood memories of Dragon Ball Z like almost every other nerd my age, I hadn’t been following anything contained in the avalanche of episodes and movies that had transpired since. This ended up being a non-issue going in: those who are at least vaguely familiar with the Dragon Ball Z level-up-and-beat-em-up gestalt are in for a fun time with this movie. Once the 20-30 minutes of plot setup are out of the way, the remainder of the movie is just one really big, bombastic, explosive anime fight. You’ll be watching two or more buff as heck anime dudes unrelentingly beat the shit out of each other for the better part of an hour. It will be some of the most breathtaking animation you have ever seen, you’ll be more-than-significantly wowed, and thoroughly entertained. In terms of visual style and action, I’d put this right up there with Into The Spider-Verse, one of the best of 2018.
